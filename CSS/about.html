                <p>After several months in the Frontend Developer Career path,
                    I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get expert 
                    code reviews of my solo projects and meet like minded peers 
                </p>

                <h2>How i stay commited to learning</h2>
                <p>I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner.
                    I used to spend hours learning,then trying to create simple
                    projects using what i learned or work new techniques into existing
                    projects
                </p>
    
                <p>While that was fun, i felt like it would be helpfull to share what
                    I was learning and most things about my jouney with the world
                </p>
            </div>
    
            <div class="article-container">
                <h2>How i got started</h2>
                <p>I started simpe an gradually grew my learning journal site.
                    I would take notes anout what I was learning.After each learning 
                    session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect n what i'd learned
                    but also write short summaries  of what I'd learnedusing my own
                    words  
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    That helped me grow what I was learning and realized that posting my 
                    leraning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated
